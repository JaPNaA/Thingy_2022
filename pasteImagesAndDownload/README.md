# Paste Images and Download

Some screenshot systems (on windows) don't let you save area-selection screenshots directly to disk. This is a pain because if you want to take several area-selection screenshots and then share or save them, you need to go through the whole (Open screenshot notification > Save > Select where to save it > Save button) process, which is quite painful.

With "Paste Images and Download," you can just Ctrl-V into the webpage and download all the pasted images into a zip!

The future of fast multi-area-screenshot saving on Windows is here!
